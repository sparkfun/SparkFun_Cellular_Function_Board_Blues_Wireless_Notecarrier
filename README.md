[*SparkFun MicroMod Cellular Function Board - Blues Wireless Notecarrier (WRL-20409)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/20409)

A MicroMod Function Board that works as a Blues Wireless Notecarrier featuring the Notecard - NOTE-NBGL-500. This Function Board adds a cellular module to the MicroMod ecosystem allowing users to send and receive data from anywhere with a compatible cellular signal. The Notecard has a built-in SIM card and includes a 10 year subscription and 500MB of data included in the price. An onboard nano SIM slot is provided for users who prefer or need to use their own SIM. The Notecard module also comes with integrated cellular, SIM, onboard GPS, 3-axis accelerometer with an on-chip temperature sensor. On top of that, the Notecard features outboard device firmware updates (DFU) meaning you can reprogram a connected Processor remotely through Blues' Notehub service! There are some limitations to this process so make sure to read through the Outboard documentation in the SparkFun Hookup Guide for more information on how to properly perform Outboard device firmware updates.
